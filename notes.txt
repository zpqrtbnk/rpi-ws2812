RP3A0

from https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/processors.html

The Raspberry Pi RP3A0 is our first System-in-Package (SiP) consisting of a Broadcom BCM2710A1 — which is the silicon die packaged inside the Broadcom BCM2837 chip which is used on the Raspberry Pi 3 — along with 512 MB of DRAM. It is used by the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

The RP3A0 is a Quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex A53 CPU clocked at 1 GHz, although with a heat sink or other cooling solution in place, the chip can be potentially overclocked to 1.2 GHz. Please refer to the BCM2836 document for details on the Arm peripherals specification, which also applies to the BCM2837 and RP3A0.

we want to use GPIO 9 aka SMI SD1

QUESTIONS

do we need to know the current CPU speed?
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq

but it is changing w/ activity?
